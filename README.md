- 👋 Hi, I’m @JMezyk
- 👀 I’m interested in C# programming
- 🌱 I’m currently learning development of Windows/web apps
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on programming. For 17 years I've worked as PLC programmer (ST, FBD, LD - mainly Beckhoff, Mitsubishi, Festo and Wago), but really down in my soul I am a C programmer. 
- 📫 How to reach me: best would be by e-mail: jordan . mezyk (at) wp . pl
- 😄 Pronouns: Mr. / him / his
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a bit nerdy, so fun is... specific. Lots of interests like sailing, motorbiking, guitar playing - it's a mix.
